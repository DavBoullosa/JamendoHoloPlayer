#Jamendo Holo Player: bringing beauty to the copyleft music

##Why
The other day I was looking for some copyleft music for a friend's project and I downloaded the official Jamendo app from the Play Store. And, in case you didn't notice, it looks like a pre-ICS application. It definitely doesn't have the aesthetics we expect nowadays. So, given Jamendo has a free and open API, why not make a Jamendo client the way it should be?

##Current status
HoloJamendo is in a veeeeery early stage. In fact it laks of many of the basic capabilities that a player should have, but this would change soon.

Currently you can:

* Listen to the tracks featured by the Jamendo team.
* Download tracks.

##Collaborate!
I'm open to collaboration, and I'm sure my code can be improved. So feel free to send me a pull request with changes and I'll be happy to take a look!

###Note for developers
I'm using the testing API Key Jamendo provides in the API documentation. You should change the API key. It's inside the Constants class.
